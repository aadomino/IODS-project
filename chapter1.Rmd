*Our era of data - larger than ever and complex like chaos - requires several skills from statisticians and other data scientists. We must discover the patterns hidden behind numbers in matrices and arrays.*  

***

We are not afraid of  

* coding,
* recoding,
* programming,
* modelling.  



We want to  

1. visualize,
2. analyze,
3. interpret:
    + understand
    + communicate  

> These are the core themes of Open Data Science and this course.
